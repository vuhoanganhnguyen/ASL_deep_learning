# American Sign Language Recognition using Residual and Inception Networks
This study investigates the use of deep learning to the task of multi-class classification of American  Sign Language (ASL). Every image in the ASL collection will be assigned one of ten digits (categories). A fully convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to perform this task on the ASL dataset. Using this as a baseline, I investigate how various CNNs might improve performance. To see how transfer learning affects performance, I train the model with pre-trained weights on the ResNet50V2 and InceptionV3 networks. In comparison to the baseline (accuracy – 79.56%) and ResNet50V2 (accuracy – 93.61%) models, I find that the InceptionV3 model (accuracy – 98.72%) outperforms. The evaluation metric accuracy is applied to compare these models, providing useful information for model selection.
